# HangmanGame
The project was created using the technical specifications located [here](https://zhukovsd.github.io/java-backend-learning-course/projects/hangman/).
User is given a random russian word that he needs to guess by writing letters in a console. If he makes 6 mistakes that means he didn't guess the word and lost the game.
